## Introduction to the accounting equation

From the large, multi-national corporation down to the corner beauty salon, every business transaction will have an effect on a company's financial position. The financial position of a company is measured by the following items:

1. Assets (what it owns)
1. Liabilities (what it owes to others)
1. Owner's Equity (the difference between assets and liabilities)

The **accounting equation** (or basic accounting equation) offers us a simple way to understand how these three amounts relate to each other. The accounting equation for a sole proprietorship is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
```

The accounting equation for a corporation is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   StockHolders's equity
```

Assets are a company's resources—things the company owns. Examples of assets include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid insurance, investments, land, buildings, equipment, and goodwill. From the accounting equation, we see that the amount of assets must equal the combined amount of liabilities plus owner's (or stockholders') equity.

Liabilities are a company's obligations—amounts the company owes. Examples of liabilities include notes or loans payable, accounts payable, salaries and wages payable, interest payable, and income taxes payable (if the company is a regular corporation). Liabilities can be viewed in two ways:

(1) as claims by creditors against the company's assets, and
(2) a source—along with owner or stockholder equity—of the company's assets.

Owner's equity or stockholders' equity is the amount left over after liabilities are deducted from assets:

```
Assets   -   Liabilities   =   Owner's (or Stockholders') Equity.
```

Owner's or stockholders' equity also reports the amounts invested into the company by the owners plus the cumulative net income of the company that has not been withdrawn or distributed to the owners.

If a company keeps accurate records, the accounting equation will always be "in balance," meaning the left side should always equal the right side. The balance is maintained because every business transaction affects at least two of a company's accounts. For example, when a company borrows money from a bank, the company's assets will increase and its liabilities will increase by the same amount. When a company purchases inventory for cash, one asset will increase and one asset will decrease. Because there are two or more accounts affected by every transaction, the accounting system is referred to as double-entry accounting.

A company keeps track of all of its transactions by recording them in accounts in the company's general ledger. Each account in the general ledger is designated as to its type: asset, liability, owner's equity, revenue, expense, gain, or loss account.

**Balance Sheet and Income Statement**

The balance sheet is also known as the statement of financial position and it reflects the accounting equation. The balance sheet reports a company's assets, liabilities, and owner's (or stockholders') equity at a specific point in time. Like the accounting equation, it shows that a company's total amount of assets equals the total amount of liabilities plus owner's (or stockholders') equity.

The income statement is the financial statement that reports a company's revenues and expenses and the resulting net income. While the balance sheet is concerned with one point in time, the income statement covers a time interval or period of time. The income statement will explain part of the change in the owner's or stockholders' equity during the time interval between two balance sheets.

In the following examples on this topic, we show how a given transaction affects the accounting equation. We also show how the same transaction affects specific accounts by providing the journal entry that is used to record the transaction in the company's general ledger.

**Examples**

In our examples in the following pages of this topic, we show how a given transaction affects the accounting equation. We also show how the same transaction affects specific accounts by providing the journal entry that is used to record the transaction in the company's general ledger.

Our examples will show the effect of each transaction on the balance sheet and income statement. Our examples also assume that the accrual basis of accounting is being followed.

Parts 2 - 6 illustrate transactions involving a sole proprietorship.

Parts 7 - 10 illustrate almost identical transactions as they would take place in a corporation.

## Accounting equation for a sole proprietorship

We present nine transactions to illustrate how a company's accounting equation stays in balance.

When a company records a business transaction, it is not entered into an accounting equation, per se. Rather, transactions are recorded into specific accounts contained in the company's general ledger. Each account is designated as an asset, liability, owner's equity, revenue, expense, gain, or loss account. The general ledger accounts are then used to prepare the balance sheets and income statements throughout the accounting periods.

In the examples that follow, we will use the following accounts:

* Cash
* Accounts Receivable
* Equipment
* Notes Payable
* Accounts Payable
* J. Ott, Capital
* J. Ott, Drawing
* Service Revenues
* Advertising Expense
* Temp Service Expense

(To view a more complete listing of accounts for recording transactions, see the [Explanation of Chart of Accounts.](#TODO))

## **Sole proprietorship transaction #1.**

Let's assume that J. Ott forms a sole proprietorship called Accounting Software Co. (ASC). On December 1, 2016, J. Ott invests personal funds of $10,000 to start ASC. The effect of this transaction on ASC's accounting equation is:

```
  Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
+$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
```

As you can see, ASC's assets increase by $10,000 and so does ASC's owner's equity. As a result, the accounting equation will be in balance.

You can interpret the amounts in the accounting equation to mean that ASC has assets of $10,000 and the source of those assets was the owner, J. Ott. Alternatively, you can view the accounting equation to mean that ASC has assets of $10,000 and there are no claims by creditors (liabilities) against the assets. As a result, the owner has a claim for the remainder or residual of $10,000.

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and the owner's equity account J. Ott, Capital. The general journal entry to record the transactions in these accounts is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 1, 2016    Cash                        10,000
                   J. Ott, Capital                          10,000
```

After the journal entry is recorded in the accounts, a balance sheet can be prepared to show ASC's financial position at the end of December 1, 2016:

```
                      Accounting Software Co.
                           Balance sheet
                          December 1, 2016


ASSETS                            LIABILITIES
────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────────────
Cash                   $  10,000
                                  OWNER'S EQUITY
                                  ────────────────────────────────
                                  J. Ott, Capital        $  10,000

                       _________                          ________
Total                  $  10,000  Total                  $  10,000
```

The purpose of an income statement is to report revenues and expenses. Since ASC has not yet earned any revenues nor incurred any expenses, there are no transactions to be reported on an income statement.

## **Sole proprietorship transaction #2.**

On December 2, 2016 J. Ott withdraws $100 of cash from the business for his personal use. The effect of this transaction on ASC's accounting equation is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
 -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
```

The accounting equation remains in balance since ASC's assets have been reduced by $100 and so has the owner's equity.

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and the owner's equity account J. Ott, Drawing. The general journal entry to record the transactions in these accounts is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 2, 2016    J. Ott, Drawing                100
                       Cash                                    100
```

Since the transactions of December 1 and 2 were each in balance, the sum of both transactions should also be in balance:

```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
                ———————       ——————————             ————————
      Total     $9,900   =            $0   +           $9,900
```

The totals indicate that ASC has assets of $9,900 and the source of those assets is the owner of the company. You can also conclude that the company has assets or resources of $9,900 and the only claim against those resources is the owner's claim.

The December 2 balance sheet will communicate the company's financial position as of midnight on December 2:

```

Withdrawals of company assets by the owner for the owner's personal use are known as "draws." Since draws are not expenses, the transaction is not reported on the company's income statement.

## **Sole proprietorship transaction #3.**

On December 3, 2016 Accounting Software Co. spends $5,000 of cash to purchase computer equipment for use in the business. The effect of this transaction on the accounting equation is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity

+$5,000
         =     No effect   +        No effect
-$5,000
```

The accounting equation reflects that one asset increases and another asset decreases. Since the amount of the increase is the same as the amount of the decrease, the accounting equation remains in balance.

This transaction is recorded in the asset accounts Equipment and Cash. Equipment increases by $5,000, and Cash decreases by $5,000. The general journal entry to record the transactions in these accounts is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 3, 2016    Equipment                    5,000
                    Cash                                     5,000
```

The combined effect of the first three transactions is shown here:

```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
               +$5,000
          3              =     No effect   +        No effect
               -$5,000
              ————————         —————————            —————————
      Total     $9,900   =            $0   +           $9,900
```

The totals tell us that the company has assets of $9,900 and the source of those assets is the owner of the company. It also tells us that the company has assets of $9,900 and the only claim against those assets is the owner's claim.

The balance sheet dated December 3, 2016 will reflect the financial position as of midnight on December 3:

```

The purchase of equipment is not an immediate expense. It will become part of depreciation expense only after it is placed into service. We will assume that as of December 3 the equipment has not been placed into service, therefore, no expense will appear on an income statement for the period of December 1 through December 3.

## **Sole proprietorship transaction #4.**

On December 4, 2016 ASC obtains $7,000 by borrowing money from its bank. The effect of this transaction on the accounting equation is:

```
 Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
+$7,000   =       +$7,000   +        No effect
```

As you can see, ASC's assets increase and ASC's liabilities increase by $7,000.

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and the liability account Notes Payable as shown in this accounting entry:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 4, 2016    Cash                         7,000
                    Notes Payable                            7,000
```

The combined effect on the accounting equation from the first four transactions is available here:

```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
               +$5,000
          3              =     No effect   +        No effect
               -$5,000
          4    +$7,000   =       +$7,000   +        No effect
              ————————           ———————            —————————
      Total    $16,900   =        $7,000   +           $9,900
```

The totals indicate that the transactions through December 4 result in assets of $16,900. There are two sources for those assets—the creditors provided $7,000 of assets, and the owner of the company provided $9,900. You can also interpret the accounting equation to say that the company has assets of $16,900 and the lenders have a claim of $7,000 and the owner has a claim for the remainder.

The balance sheet dated December 4 will report ASC's financial position as of that date:

```

The proceeds of the bank loan are not considered to be revenue since ASC did not earn the money by providing services, investing, etc. As a result, there is no income statement effect from this transaction.

## **Sole proprietorship transaction #5.**

On December 5, 2016 Accounting Software Co. pays $600 for ads that were run in recent days. The effect of this advertising transaction on the accounting equation is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
 -$600   =     No Effect   +            -$600
```

Since ASC is paying $600, its assets decrease. The second effect is a $600 decrease in owner's equity, because the transaction involves an expense. (An expense is a cost that is used up or its future economic value cannot be measured.)

Although owner's equity is decreased by an expense, the transaction is not recorded directly into the owner's capital account at this time. Instead, the amount is initially recorded in the expense account Advertising Expense and in the asset account Cash.

The general journal entry to record the transaction is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit

      Total    $16,300   =        $7,000   +           $9,300
```

The totals now indicate that Accounting Software Co. has assets of $16,300. The creditors provided $7,000 and the owner of the company provided $9,300. Viewed another way, the company has assets of $16,300 with the creditors having a claim of $7,000 and the owner having a residual claim of $9,300.

**The income statement (which reports the company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses during a specified time interval) is a link between balance sheets. It provides the results of operations—an important part of the change in owner's equity.

Since this transaction involves an expense, it will involve ASC's income statement. The company's income statement for the first five days of December is:

```

## **Sole Proprietorship Transaction #6.**

On December 6, 2016 ASC performs consulting services for its clients. The clients are billed for the agreed upon amount of $900. The amounts are due in 30 days. The effect on the accounting equation is:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
 +$900   =     No Effect   +            +$900
```

Since ASC has performed the services, it has earned revenues and it has the right to receive $900 from the clients. This right (known as an account receivable) causes assets to increase. The earning of revenues causes owner's equity to increase.

Although revenues cause owner's equity to increase, the revenue transaction is not recorded into the owner's capital account at this time. Rather, the amount earned is recorded in the revenue account Service Revenues. This will allow the company to report the revenues on its income statement at any time. (After the year ends, the amount in the revenue account will be transferred to the owner's capital account.)

The general journal entry to record the transaction is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 6, 2016    Accounts Receivable            900
                     Services Revenues                         900
```

The combined effect of the first six transactions can be viewed here:

```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
               +$5,000
          3              =     No effect   +        No effect
               -$5,000
          4    +$7,000   =       +$7,000   +        No effect
          5      -$600   =     No effect   +            -$600
          6      +$900   =     No effect   +            +$900
              ————————         —————————            —————————
      Total    $17,200   =        $7,000   +          $10,200
```

The totals tell us that at the end of December 6, the company has assets of $17,200. It also shows the sources of the assets: creditors providing $7,000 and the owner of the company providing $10,200. The totals also reveal that the company has assets of $17,200 and the creditors have a claim of $7,000 and the owner has a claim for the remaining $10,200.

## **Sole Proprietorship Transaction #7.**

On December 7, 2016 ASC uses a temporary help service for 6 hours at a cost of $20 per hour. ASC will pay the invoice when it is due in 10 days. The effect on its accounting equation is:

```
   Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
No effect   =         +$120   +            -$120
```

ASC's liabilities increase by $120 and the expense causes owner's equity to decrease by $120.

The liability will be recorded in Accounts Payable and the expense will be reported in Temp Service Expense. The journal entry for recording the use of the temp service is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 7, 2016    Temp Service Expense           120
                    Accounts Payable                           120
```

The effect of the first seven transactions on the accounting equation can be viewed here:

```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100
               +$5,000
          3              =     No effect   +        No effect
               -$5,000
          4    +$7,000   =       +$7,000   +        No effect
          5      -$600   =     No effect   +            -$600
          6      +$900   =     No effect   +            +$900
          7  No effect   =         +$120   +            -$120
              ————————         —————————            —————————
      Total    $17,200   =        $7,120   +          $10,080
```

The totals show us that the company has assets of $17,200 and the sources are the creditors with $7,120 and the owner of the company with $10,080. The accounting equation totals also tell us that the company has assets of $17,200 with the creditors having a claim of $7,120. This means that the owner's residual claim is $10,080.

## **Sole Proprietorship Transaction #8.**

On December 8, 2016 ASC receives $500 from the clients it had billed on December 6, 2016. The collection of accounts receivables has this effect on the accounting equation:

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
 +$500
         =     No effect   +        No effect
 -$500          
```

The company's asset (cash) increases and another asset (accounts receivable) decreases. Liabilities and owner's equity are unaffected. (There are no revenues on this date. The revenues were recorded when they were earned on December 6.)

The general journal entry to record the increase in Cash, and the decrease in Accounts Receivable is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 8, 2016    Cash                           500
                    Accounts Receivable                        500
```

The combined effect of the first eight transactions is shown here:


```
Transaction     Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's equity
          1   +$10,000   =     No effect   +         +$10,000
          2      -$100   =     No effect   +            -$100

          5      -$600   =     No effect   +            -$600
          6      +$900   =     No effect   +            +$900
          7  No effect   =         +$120   +            -$120

              ————————         —————————            —————————
      Total    $17,200   =        $7,120   +          $10,080
```

The totals for the first eight transactions indicate that the company has assets of $17,200. The creditors provided $7,120 and the owner provided $10,080. The accounting equation also indicates that the company's creditors have a claim of $7,120 and the owner has a residual claim of $10,080.

## Calculating a missing amount within owner's equity

The income statement for the calendar year 2016 will explain a portion of the change in the owner's equity between the balance sheets of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016. The other items that account for the change in owner's equity are the owner's investments into the sole proprietorship and the owner's draws (or withdrawals). A recap of these changes is the *statement of changes in owner's equity*. Here is a statement of changes in owner's equity for the year 2016 assuming that the Accounting Software Co. had only the eight transactions that we covered earlier.

```
            Accounting Software Co.
       State of Changes in Owner's Equity
     For the Year Ended December 31, 2016

  Add: Owner's investment                $ 10,000
    Net income                           $    180
                                          _______
      Subtotal                           $ 10,180  
  Deduct: Owner's draws                  $    100    
                                          _______
Owner's equity at December 31, 2016      $ 10,080                                           
```

**Example of calculating a missing amount**

The format of the statement of changes in owner's equity can be used to determine one of these components if it is unknown. For example, if the net income for the year 2016 is unknown, but you know the amount of the draws and the beginning and ending balances of owner's equity, you can calculate the net income. (This might be necessary if a company does not have complete records of its revenues and expenses.) Let's demonstrate this by using the following amounts.

```
Assetes as of December 31, 2015          $ 100,000
Liabilities as of December 31, 2015      $  40,000
Assets as of December 31, 2016           $ 128,000
Liabilities as of December 31, 2016      $  34,000
Owner investment in business in 2016     $  10,000
Owner draws in 2016                      $  40,000
```

**Step 1.**
The owner's equity at December 31, 2015 can be computed using the accounting equation:


```
             Assetes   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's Equity
           $ 100,000   =      $ 40,000   +   Owner's Equity
$ 100,000 - $ 40,000   =                     Owner's Equity    
            $ 60,000   =    Owner's Equity at Dec. 31, 2015
```

**Step 2.**
The owner's equity at December 31, 2016 can be computed as well:

```
             Assetes   =   Liabilities   +   Owner's Equity
           $ 128,000   =      $ 34,000   +   Owner's Equity
$ 128,000 - $ 34,000   =                     Owner's Equity    
            $ 94,000   =    Owner's Equity at Dec. 31, 2016
```

**Step 3.**
Insert into the statement of changes in owner's equity the information that was given and the amounts calculated in Step 1 and Step 2:


```
Owner's Equity at December 31, 2015    $  60,000 (Step 1)
  Add: Owner's investment            + $  10,000  (given)
    Net income                       +         ?
                                         _______
      Subtotal                                 ?
Deduct: Owner's draws                - $  40,000  (given)
                                         _______
Owner's equity at December 31, 2016    $  94,000 (Step 2)                                        
```

**Step 4.**
The "Subtotal" can be calculated by adding the last two numbers on the statement: $94,000 + $40,000 = $134,000. After this calculation we have:


```
Owner's Equity at December 31, 2015    $  60,000 (Step 1)
  Add: Owner's investment            + $  10,000  (given)
    Net income                       +         ?
                                         _______
      Subtotal                         $ 134,000 (Step 4)
Deduct: Owner's draws                - $  40,000  (given)
                                         _______
Owner's equity at December 31, 2016    $  94,000 (Step 2)                                        
```

**Step 5.**
Starting at the top of the statement we know that the owner's equity before the start of 2016 was $60,000 and in 2016 the owner invested an additional $10,000. As a result we have $70,000 before considering the amount of Net Income. We also know that after the amount of Net Income is added, the Subtotal has to be $134,000 (the Subtotal calculated in Step 4). The Net Income is the difference between $70,000 and $134,000. **Net income must have been $64,000.**

**Step 6.**
Insert the previously missing amount (in this case it is the $64,000 of net income) into the statement of changes in owner's equity and recheck the math:

```
Owner's Equity at December 31, 2013    $  60,000 (Step 1)
  Add: Owner's investment            + $  10,000  (given)
    Net income                       + $  64,000 (Step 5)
                                         _______
      Subtotal                         $ 134,000 (Step 4)
Deduct: Owner's draws                - $  40,000  (given)
                                         _______
Owner's equity at December 31, 2014    $  94,000 (Step 2)                                        
```

Since the statement is mathematically correct, we are confident that the net income was $64,000.

## Accounting equation for a corporation

The accounting equation (or basic accounting equation) for a corporation is

```
Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
```

In our examples below, we show how a given transaction affects the accounting equation for a corporation. We also show how the same transaction will be recorded in the company's general ledger accounts.

Our examples will also show the effect of each transaction on the balance sheet and income statement. For all of our examples we assume that the **accrual basis** of accounting is being followed.

In the examples that follow, we will use the following accounts:

* Cash
* Accounts Receivable
* Equipment
* Notes Payable
* Accounts Payable
* Common Stock
* Retained Earnings
* Treasury Stock
* Service Revenues
* Advertising Expense
* Temp Service Expense

We also assume that the corporation is a Subchapter S corporation in order to avoid the income tax accounting that would occur with a "C" corporation. (In a Subchapter S corporation the owners are responsible for the income taxes instead of the corporation.)

## Corporation transaction c1

Let's assume that members of the Ott family form a corporation called Accounting Software, Inc. (ASI). On December 1, 2016, several members of the Ott family invest a total of $10,000 to start ASI. In exchange, the corporation issues a total of 1,000 shares of common stock. (The stock has no par value and no stated value.) The effect on the corporation's accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
+ $ 10,000   =     No effect   +             + $ 10,000
```

As you see, ASI's assets increase by $10,000 and stockholders' equity increases by the same amount. As a result, the accounting equation will be in balance.

The accounting equation tells us that ASI has assets of $10,000 and the source of those assets was the stockholders. Alternatively, the accounting equation tells us that the corporation has assets of $10,000 and the only claim to the assets is from the stockholders (owners).

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and in the stockholders' equity account Common Stock. The general journal entry to record the transaction is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 1, 2016    Cash                        10,000
                     Common Stock                           10,000
```

After the journal entry is recorded in the accounts, a balance sheet can be prepared to show ASI's financial position at the end of December 1, 2016:

```
                      Accounting Software Co.
                           Balance sheet
                          December 1, 2016


ASSETS                            LIABILITIES
────────────────────────────────  ────────────────────────────────
Cash                   $  10,000  Stockholders' Equity         
                                    Common stock         $  10,000
                      __________                        __________
                                  Total liabilities & 
Total assets           $  10,000    stockholders' equity $  10,000  
```

The purpose of an income statement is to report revenues and expenses. Since ASI has not yet earned any revenues nor incurred any expenses, there are no transactions to be reported on an income statement.

## Corporation transaction c2.

On December 2, 2016 ASI purchases $100 of its stock from one of its stockholders. The stock will be held by the corporation as Treasury Stock. The effect of the accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
   - $ 100   =     No effect   +                - $ 100
```

The purchase of its own stock for cash meant that ASI's assets decrease by $100 and its stockholders' equity decreases by $100.

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and in the stockholders' equity account Treasury Stock. The accounting entry in general journal form is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 2, 2016    Treasury Stock                 100
                     Cash                                      100
```

Since the transactions of December 1 and 2 were each in balance, the sum of both transactions should also be in balance:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000
         C2  -$   100   =     No effect   +               -$   100
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————        
     Totals   $ 9,900   =        $    0   +                $ 9,900
```

The totals indicate that ASI has assets of $9,900 and the source of those assets is the stockholders. The accounting equation also shows that the corporation has assets of $9,900 and the only claim against those resources is the stockholders' claim.

The December 2 balance sheet will communicate the corporation's financial position as of midnight on December 2:

```

The purchase of a corporation's own stock will never result in an amount to be reported on the income statement.

## Corporation transaction c3.

On December 3, 2016 ASI spends $5,000 of cash to purchase computer equipment for use in the business. The effect of this transaction on its accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
 + $ 5,000   
             =     No effect   +              No effect
 - $ 5,000            
```

The accounting equation indicates that one asset increases and one asset decreases. Since the amount of the increase is the same as the amount of the decrease, the accounting equation remains in balance.

This transaction is recorded in the asset accounts Equipment and Cash. The account increases by $5,000 and the account decreases by $5,000. The journal entry for this transaction is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 3, 2016    Equipment                    5,000
                     Cash                                    5,000
```

The effect on the accounting equation from the first three transactions is:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000
         C2  -$   100   =     No effect   +               -$   100
             +$ 5,000
         C3             =     No effect   +              No effect
             -$ 5,000   
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————       
     Totals   $ 9,900   =        $    0   +                $ 9,900
```

The totals tell us that the corporation has assets of $9,900 and the source of those assets is the stockholders. The totals tell us that the company has assets of $9,900 and that the only claim against those assets is the stockholders' claim.

The balance sheet dated December 3, 2016 reflects the financial position of the corporation as of midnight on December 3:

The purchase of equipment is not an immediate expense. It will become depreciation expense only after the equipment is placed in service. We will assume that as of December 3 the equipment has not been placed into service. Therefore, there is no expense in this transaction or in the earlier transactions to be reported on the income statement.

## Corporation transaction c4.

On December 4, 2016 ASI obtains $7,000 by borrowing money from its bank. The effect of this transaction on the accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity  
 + $ 7,000   =     + $ 7,000   +              No effect      
```

As you see, ACI's assets increase and its liabilities increase by $7,000.

This transaction is recorded in the asset account Cash and the liability account Notes Payable with the following journal entry:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 4, 2016    Cash                         7,000
                     Notes Payable                           7,000
```

To see the effect on the accounting equation from the first four transactions:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000
         C2  -$   100   =     No effect   +               -$   100
             +$ 5,000
         C3             =     No effect   +              No effect
             -$ 5,000   
         C4  +$ 7,000   =     + $ 7,000   +              No effect  
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————        
     Totals  $ 16,900   =       $ 7,000   +                $ 9,900
```

These totals indicate that the transactions through December 4 result in assets of $16,900. There are two sources for those assets: the creditors provided $7,000 of assets, and the stockholders provided $9,900. You can also interpret the accounting equation to say that the corporation has assets of $16,900 and the creditors have a claim of $7,000. The residual or remainder of $9,900 is the stockholders' claim.

The balance sheet dated December 4 reports the corporation's financial position as of that date:

```

The receipt of money from the bank loan is not revenue since ASI did not earn the money by providing services, investing, etc. As a result, there is no income statement effect from this transaction or earlier transactions.

## Corporation transaction c5.

On December 5, 2016 Accounting Software, Inc. pays $600 for ads that were run in recent days. The effect of the advertising transaction on the corporation's accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity  
   - $ 600   =     No effect   +                - $ 600      
```

Since ASI is paying $600, its assets decrease. The second effect is a $600 decrease in stockholders' equity, because the transaction involves an expense. (An expense is a cost that is used up or its future economic value cannot be measured.)

Although stockholders' equity decreases because of an expense, the transaction is not recorded directly into the retained earnings account. Instead, the amount is initially recorded in the expense account Advertising Expense and in the asset account Cash. The journal entry for this transaction is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 5, 2016    Advertising Expense            600
                     Cash                                      600
```

The combined effect of the first five transactions is:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000
         C2  -$   100   =     No effect   +               -$   100
             +$ 5,000
         C3             =     No effect   +              No effect
             -$ 5,000   
         C4  +$ 7,000   =     + $ 7,000   +              No effect 
         C5  -$   600   =     No effect   +               -$   600
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————        
     Totals  $ 16,300   =       $ 7,000   +                $ 9,300
```

The totals now indicate that Accounting Software, Inc. has assets of $16,300. The creditors provided $7,000 and the stockholders provided $9,300. Viewed another way, the corporation has assets of $16,300 with the creditors having a claim of $7,000 and the stockholders having a claim of $9,300.

**The income statement (which reports the company's revenues, expenses, gains, and losses for a specified time period) is a link between balance sheets. It provides the results of operations—an important part of the change in retained earnings and stockholders' equity.

Since this transaction involves an expense, it will affect ASI's income statement. The corporation's income statement for the first five days of December is presented here:

```
            Accounting Software Co.
               Income Statement

```

*Because we assume that Accounting Services, Inc. is a Subchapter S corporation, income tax expense is not reported on the corporation's income statement.*

## Corporation transaction c6.

On December 6, 2016 ASI performs consulting services for its clients. The clients are billed for the agreed upon amount of $900. The amounts are due in 30 days. The effect on the accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity  
   + $ 900   =     No effect   +                + $ 900      
```

Since ASI has performed the services, it has earned revenues and it has the right to receive $900 from its clients. This right means that assets increased. The earning of revenues also causes stockholders' equity to increase.

Although revenues cause stockholders' equity to increase, the revenue transaction is not recorded directly into a stockholders' equity account at this time. Rather, the amount earned is recorded in the revenues account Service Revenues . This will allow the corporation to report the revenues account on its income statement at any time. (After the year ends, the amount in the revenues accounts will be transferred to the retained earnings account.) The general journal entry for providing services on credit is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 6, 2016    Accounts Receivable            900
                     Service Revenues                          900
```

The effect on the accounting equation from the first six transactions can be viewed here:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000
         C2  -$   100   =     No effect   +               -$   100
             +$ 5,000
         C3             =     No effect   +              No effect
             -$ 5,000   
         C4  +$ 7,000   =     + $ 7,000   +              No effect 
         C5  -$   600   =     No effect   +               -$   600
         C6  +$   900   =     No effect   +               +$   900
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————        
     Totals   $17,200   =       $ 7,000   +                $10,200
```

The totals tell us that at the end of December 6, the corporation has assets of $17,200. It also shows that $7,000 of the assets came from creditors and that $10,200 came from stockholders. The totals can also be viewed another way: ASI has assets of $17,200 with its creditors having a claim of $7,000 and the stockholders having a claim for the remainder or residual of $10,200.

## Corporation transaction c7.

On December 7, 2016 ASI uses a temporary help service for 6 hours at a cost of $20 per hour. ASI records the invoice immediately, but it will pay the $120 when it is due in 10 days. This transaction has the following effect on the accounting equation:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity  
 No effect   =       + $ 120   +                - $ 120      
```

The accounting equation shows that ASI's liabilities increase by $120 and the expense causes stockholders' equity to decrease by $120.

The liability will be recorded in Accounts Payable and the expense will be recorded in Temp Service Expense. The general journal entry for utilizing the temp service is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 7, 2016    Temp Service Expense           120
                     Accounts Payable                          120
```

The effect of the first seven transactions on the accounting equation can be viewed here:

```
Transaction    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity
         C1  +$10,000   =     No effect   +               +$10,000

## Corporation transaction c8.

On December 8, 2016 ASI receives $500 from the clients it had billed on December 6. The effect on the accounting equation is:

```
    Assets   =   Liabilities   +   Stockholders' Equity 
   + $ 500 
             =     No effect   +              No effect   
   - $ 500          
```

The corporation's cash increases and one of its other assets (accounts receivable) decreases. Liabilities and stockholders' equity are unaffected. (There are no revenues on this date. The revenues were recorded when they were earned on December 6.)

The general journal entry to record the increase in Cash and the decrease in Accounts Receivable is:

```
Date            Account Name                 Debit          Credit
——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
Dec. 8, 2016    Cash                           500
                     Accounts Receivable                       500
```

The effect on the accounting equation from the transactions through December 8 is shown here:

```

     Totals   $17,200   =       $ 7,120   +                $10,080
```

The totals after the first eight transactions indicate that the corporation has assets of $17,200. The creditors have provided $7,120 and the company's stockholders have provided $10,080. The accounting equation also indicates that the company's creditors have a claim of $7,120 and the stockholders have a residual claim of $10,080.

## Expanded accounting equation for a sole proprietorship

The owner's equity in the basic accounting equation is sometimes expanded to show the accounts that make up owner's equity: Owner's Capital, Revenues, Expenses, and Owner's Draws.

Instead of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity, the **expanded accounting equation** is:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Capital + Revenues - Expenses - Owner's Draws         
```

The eight transactions that we had listed under the basic accounting equation **Transaction 8**, are shown in the following expanded accounting equation:

**INSERTAR TABLA**

With the expanded accounting equation, you can easily see the company's net income:

```
Revenues           $  900
- Expenses         $  720
                  _______
Net income         $  180                  
```

## Expanded accounting equation for a corporation

The stockholders' equity part of the basic accounting equation can also be expanded to show the accounts that make up stockholders' equity: Paid-in Capital, Revenues, Expenses, Dividends, and Treasury Stock.

Instead of the accounting equation, Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity, the expanded accounting equation is:

```
Assets = Liabilities + Paid-in Capital + Revenues -Expenses - Dividends - Treasury Stock         
```

The eight transactions that we had listed under the basic accounting equation **Transaction C8** are shown in the following expanded accounting equation:

With the expanded accounting equation, you can easily see the corporation's net income:
