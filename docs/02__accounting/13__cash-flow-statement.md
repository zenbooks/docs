# Introduction to Cash Flow Statement

1. [What can the statement of cash flows tell us?](#what-can-the statement-of-cash-flows-tell-us?)

The official name for the cash flow statement is the statement of cash flows. We will use both names throughout AccountingCoach.com.

The statement of cash flows is one of the main financial statements. (The other financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of stockholders' equity.)

The cash flow statement reports the cash generated and used during the time interval specified in its heading. The period of time that the statement covers is chosen by the company. For example, the heading may state "For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016" or "The Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2016".

The cash flow statement organizes and reports the cash generated and used in the following categories:

1. Operating activities: converts the items reported on the income statement from the accrual basis of accounting to cash.

1. Investing activities: reports the purchase and sale of long-term investments and property, plant and equipment.

1. Financing activities: reports the issuance and repurchase of the company's own bonds and stock and the payment of dividends.

1. Supplemental information: reports the exchange of significant items that did not involve cash and reports the amount of income taxes paid and interest paid.

## What can the statement of cash flows tell us?

Because the income statement is prepared under the accrual basis of accounting, the revenues reported may not have been collected. Similarly, the expenses reported on the income statement might not have been paid. You could review the balance sheet changes to determine the facts, but the cash flow statement already has integrated all that information. As a result, savvy business people and investors utilize this important financial statement.

Here are a few ways the statement of cash flows is used.

The cash from operating activities is compared to the company's net income. If the cash from operating activities is consistently greater than the net income, the company's net income or earnings are said to be of a "high quality". If the cash from operating activities is less than net income, a red flag is raised as to why the reported net income is not turning into cash.
Some investors believe that "cash is king". The cash flow statement identifies the cash that is flowing in and out of the company. If a company is consistently generating more cash than it is using, the company will be able to increase its dividend, buy back some of its stock, reduce debt, or acquire another company. All of these are perceived to be good for stockholder value.
Some financial models are based upon cash flow.

## Format of the statement of cash flows

The statement of cash flows has four distinct sections:

1. Cash involving operating activities
1. Cash involving investing activities
1. Cash involving financing activities
1. Supplemental information.

Assuming that the cash flow statement is being prepared using the indirect method (the method used by most companies) the differences in a company's balance sheet accounts will provide much of the needed information. For example, if the statement of cash flows is for the year 2016, the balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2016 will be compared to the balance sheet accounts at December 31, 2015. The changes—or differences—in these account balances will likely be entered in one of the sections of the statement of cash flows.

Shown below is each of the four sections of the statement of cash flows, followed by a list of those balance sheet accounts which affect it.

## 1. Cash provided from or used by operating activities

This section of the cash flow statement reports the company's net income and then converts it from the accrual basis to the cash basis by using the changes in the balances of current asset and current liability accounts, such as:

Accounts Receivable
Inventory
Supplies
Prepaid Insurance
Other Current Assets
Notes Payble
Accounts Payable
Wages Payable
Payroll Taxes Payable
Interest Payable
Income Taxes Payable
Unearned Revenues
Other Current Liabilities

In addition to using the changes in current assets and current liabilities, the operating activities section has adjustments for depreciation expense and for the gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets.

## 2. Cash provided from or used by investing activities

This section of the cash flow statement reports changes in the balances of long-term asset accounts, such as:

Long-term Investments
Land
Buildings
Equipment
Furniture & Fixtures
Vehicles

In short, investing activities involve the purchase and/or sale of long-term investments and property, plant, and equipment.

## 3. Cash provided from or used by financing activities

This section of the cash flow statement reports changes in balances of the long-term liability and stockholders' equity accounts, such as:

Notes Payable (generally due after one year)
Bonds Payable
Deferred Income Taxes
Preferred Stock
Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par-Preferred Stock
Common Stock
Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par-Common Stock
Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock
Retained Earnings
Treasury Stock

In short, financing activities involve the issuance and/or the repurchase of a company's own bonds or stock as well as short-term and long-term borrowings and repayments.

## 4. Supplemental information

This section of the cash flow statement discloses the amount of interest and income taxes paid. Also reported are significant exchanges not involving cash. For example, the exchange of company stock for company bonds would be reported in this section.
